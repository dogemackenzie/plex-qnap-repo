Seamless Integration: Works directly with QNAP's App Center for hassle-free installation and updates.

Verification and Troubleshooting

Check Installation: After installing, verify Plex is running by accessing the web interface or checking the App Center status.
Logs: If issues occur, review Plex logs located at /share/PlexData/Logs on your NAS (accessible via SSH or File Station).
Common Issues:
App Not Appearing: Ensure the repo URL is correct and accessible (test in a browser). Refresh the App Center multiple times if needed.
Installation Fails: Confirm your NAS model and architecture are supported (e.g., TS-x53 series for x86). Check for sufficient storage space.
Port Conflicts: Plex uses port 32400/tcp by defaultâ€”ensure it's not blocked by your NAS firewall or router.
